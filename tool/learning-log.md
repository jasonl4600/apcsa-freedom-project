### 10/20/2024:
* I will be using the 2d element of godot
* Your scene is the thing that contains all the elements you add
* Throughout the 2d canvas, the blue box represents your game window
* I downloaded a pack full of assets such as backgrounds. Based on the tutorial I'm following I added a background png from the texture pack into the file. Using this I created a new node, TextureRect and dragged the png into it to create our background.
* Creating a new node child node, TileMap allows me to give it a terrain based on the texture pack and access terrain material from that texture pack. With it I can add tiles and create a map.
