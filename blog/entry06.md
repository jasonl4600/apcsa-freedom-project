# In class presentations

After finishing our mvps and beyond mvps we move onto the presentation process. We practiced presenting and pitching our project to an audience which would be our class. My [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12xopF6Oz21LO7N8DptT2SDHipW3bY3QS5HqsoK8sp2w/edit?usp=sharing) followed the same format I used for SEP11. I wanted to focus on minimalizing text, instead, using graphics and words to describe my processes and what is being shown throughout the slides. One flaw I can see in myself is my inability to improvise. Through practicing my presentations I've come up with the realization that I currently lack the ability to present formally unless I memorize what I should say and when like a script in my mind. If I were to forget a part or two improvisation would need to take place which is something I need to work on. Not being able to improvise creates filler space that leads to many "ums" and "uhs" in a presentation which creates weakness to the overall message to be presented.

# Expo elevator pitch

In a shorter presentation, in this case, a elevator pitch I was able to successfully get my message through. I think one point I was able to excel in was being able to present naturally. This year compared to previous expo's I felt that I was able to present my elevator pitch in a more relaxed manner without stress or other complications. I think this is a important skill to keep and use in the future.

# Skills

* I've been able to see a weakness in my ability to improvise as my in class presentation reflects.
* Being able to present in a way where a persons character is naturally shown is a important skill I believe to have demonstrated and gained in my elevator pitch.

# Conclusion
As the final blog entry I feel confident in my ability to reflect on the many skills and takeaways I've been able to gather throughout my 4 years in the SEP program. Many of these coming not in the form of programming skills, but communication, presentation, teamwork, and implementation. Self reflecting on the skills I've gained throughout the years I can say with confidence I've been able to better myself through the freedom project experience and the SEP program as a whole.
